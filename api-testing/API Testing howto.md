There's an API testing collection provided to play with the API quickly, without any programming.

It's using an online Postman open source alternative: `hoppscotch.io`. You don't need to register account, just open the website and follow those steps:

1. Open `hoppscotch.io` in your web browser
2. Import `hoppscotch-collection.json` file and `hoppscotch-environment.json` 
3. Fill in missing `userID` and `token` values. Those can be found in your `TaskRabbit` account settings.
